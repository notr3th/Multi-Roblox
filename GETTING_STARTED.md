# Getting Started with Multi Roblox 🎮🔓

## Download ⬇️
[Download RoViewer.exe (direct link) 🔗](https://github.com/notr3th/Multi-Roblox/releases/latest/download/RoViewer.exe)

## Run 🚀
RoViewer is portable, so you can run it right away. However, it's a good idea to add it to the `StartUp` folder so that Windows automatically opens it when you start your PC.

To do that, follow these steps:
1. **Open the Run Dialog**:
   - Press the <kbd>Win</kbd> key (the Windows key) and the <kbd>R</kbd> key simultaneously. This will open the Run dialog box.

2. **Navigate to the Startup Folder**:
   - In the Run dialog box, paste the following path: `%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp`.
   - Click on `OK` to open the Startup folder.

3. **Add RoViewer to the Startup Folder**:
   - Locate the `RoViewer.exe` file that you have downloaded.
   - Drag and drop the `RoViewer.exe` file into the Startup folder that you opened in the previous step.

4. **Launch RoViewer**:
   - You can now launch RoViewer by double-clicking the `RoViewer.exe` file in the Startup folder.
   - Alternatively, you can restart your PC to ensure that RoViewer starts automatically the next time you log in.

By following these steps, you will ensure that RoViewer is set to run automatically whenever you start your computer.
